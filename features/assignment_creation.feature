    And the teacher "John"

    And   I follow "Nuevo"
    And   I fill in "assignment_name" with "TP0" within ".form-horizontal"
    And   I fill in "assignment_test_script" with "#!/bin/bash\necho $?" within ".form-horizontal"
    And   I fill in "assignment_deadline" with "20/10/2013" within ".form-horizontal"
